    "Measures of Central Tendency -\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (Average) - The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. It provides the most information of any measure of central tendency, but it is sensitive to outliers. The mean is often used to describe the typical value of a dataset, especially when the data is normally distributed. However, extreme values can significantly impact the mean, making it less representative in skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median - The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. It is less sensitive to extreme values compared to the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency, particularly in skewed distributions. The median is useful for describing the central value of a dataset when extreme values are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode - The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is particularly useful for identifying the most common value or category in a dataset, especially in categorical data. However, the mode may not fully represent the central tendency if the dataset is not concentrated around a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability -\n",
    "Variance: The variance measures how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean. It provides a measure of the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean. A higher variance indicates greater variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance of data points from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates greater dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "How They Are Used:\n",
    "Mean - The mean is commonly used to describe the average value of a dataset, especially when the data is normally distributed and there are no extreme values that significantly impact the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median - The median is used to describe the central value of a dataset, particularly when the data is skewed or contains extreme values that could distort the mean.\n",
